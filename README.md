# J.P.Morgan Chase and its Evolving Relationship with Fintech

## Overview and Origin

J.P.Morgan Chase & Co.'s was incorporated in the year 2000 after J.P.Morgan & Co. merged with The Chase Manhattan Corporation to form the J.P.Morgan Chase & Co. we know today. However, the history of these two firms along with Bank One is rich and dates back through the larger part of U.S. history!

The history of J.P.Morgan Chase & Co. is long and the result of various mergers during the early 2000s. JPM founder was none other than John Pierpont Morgan whereas the Chase Manhattan Corporation was founded by John Thompson and Bank One's predecessor Banc One was founded by John McCoy. The 2000 merger between J.P.Morgan & Co. and The Chase Manhattan Corporation was largely the result of JPM transition from "a commercial bank with a blue-chip list of clients into a firm focused on investment banking" alongside Chase's ambition to "catapult... into the big leagues of investment banking." (NYTimes) The 2004 merger between J.P.Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank One (retaining the former name) was the result of "a bid to leverage the latter's(Bank One) consumer banking business" as a complement to JPM Chase's "well-established investment and commercial banking business." (Cascade Strategy)

Retroactively, we can see the long history of success as a bank that J.P.Morgan Chase & Co. has had over its over 200 years of a longstanding history of disrupting the financial industry with technological advancements such as the introduction of the electronic processing of checks and the introduction of credit cards, ATMs and online banking! Today, alongside the acquisition of the First Republic Bank, and talks about how JPM Chase & Co. has become an industry leader in part due to the leadership of their current chairman & CEO, Jamie Dimon.


## Business Activities

Today, JPMorgan's relationship with digital innovation and fintech is geared towards partnering with various companies to "identify and analyze digital trends, emerging challenges and expansion opportunities" and develop "forward-thinking ideas that optimize and transform existing franchises or result in new businesses, products, and services." (JPMorgan) In summary, JPM's current summary involves a broader approach towards fintech, and considering its large workforce and market cap, it is easy to see why they would take this approach over a more niche function. This has resulted in various partnerships with market-leading companies and start-ups such as AreaX, a program geared towards turning "a concept to working prototype" within 3 months, to Github, an open-source community for collaborative app development.

Because JPM is an industry leader and household name, their company's access to the bigger slice of the market share is inevitable and a decisive advantage over other competitors and what they offer is a large trove of capital investment to "co-create products and incubate startups." Due to JPM's business structure and partnering strategies, they have the ability to work fast like a startup and leverage their wealth and established name.

As of today, JPM uses technologies such as jQuery, Modernizr, Oracle Dyn, Adobe Experience, GitHub, and J.P.Morgan Developer. Each of these applications serves a variety of purposes from collaborating with other software developers through their open-source codes on GitHub, to their use of apps such as jQuery and Adobe Experience to improve workflow and related efficiencies. A lot of what JPM does is centered around empowering smaller companies and eventually acquiring them while continuing to be a leading provider of traditional commercial banking solutions.


## Landscape

As one might expect, JPM industry is largely centered around commercial and investment banking as a long-established powerhouse for secure banking and industry-leading advisory in mergers & acquisition as one of the top bulge-bracket firms in the world. Today, JPM's major trends of the past 5-10 years have been continuing down their traditional strategies of mergers & acquisitions as well as the implementation of new programs to support traditionally underrepresented/disadvantaged communities. These programs include Women on the Move, Financing Detroit, AdvancingCities, and Advancing Black Pathways.

When one thinks of natural competitors, the names that come to mind typically include other bulge-bracket investment banks. As such, companies such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup typically come to mind. It is important to note that "following the global financial crisis of 2008, 'bulge bracket' as a catchall term has been somewhat outmoded by the practice of referring to investment banks as 'tier one,' 'tier two,' or 'tier three' investment banks."(Investopedia) with JPMorgan Chase emerging as "the only tier one investment bank"(Investopedia) due to its dominance across most product areas.


## Results

To date, JPMorgan Chase has served over 100 global markets and maintained a small business clients list of 5 million across all of its services. In addition, JPM Chase has a track record of a positive social impact including committing 30 billion USD towards racial equity, 2.5 trillion USD towards sustainable development, and helping to develop 215 thousand affordable housing units. (JPMorgan)

YTD, JPMorgan has seen a 5.90% increase. When compared to Morgan Stanley's 3.88% increase YTD, Goldman Sachs' 1.87% decrease YTD, and Bank of America's 12.35% decrease YTD, we see that JPM has managed to notably outperform industry competitors in an industry sustaining high levels of volatility due to record level inflation rates and Federal Reserve interest rates. As JP Morgan continues to develop its presence in the Fintech and software development space, it will be interesting to see what new competitors emerge and what the future of banking solutions looks like.

## Recommendations

If I were to advise the company, a major product/service I would recommend developing would be a financial roboadvisor. With the advent of A.I. and machine learning, it would be interesting to see how machine learning would disrupt the wealth management sector of JP Morgan from a private client advisor for high-net-worth individuals position to a position of easy, affordable investment solutions for the working and middle class.

This product/solution would ultimately expand the market to include a larger client base, and considering that a roboadvisor program would be significantly more affordable than employees, the ability to provide the service to those with lesser means is clear to see. That is not to say that private client advisors would immediately become unnecessary in the short-term, rather, the in-person service could be more compartmentalized for those who invest a sufficient amount to afford the additional, more expensive service. In addition, the introduction of Apple's AR headset could pave the way for additional services such as a 3d model of a roboadvisor that clients can access right from the comfort of their own homes.

All in all, this additional resource could be accessible through the current means we have today such as one's phone or computer through an application or via a website or call, whereas the more immersive augmented reality version could be accessed through the current and future iteration of today's AR/VR headsets. These technologies would be the easiest to implement through these means in the short term since software development talent is already familiar with creating code for these devices. In the end, the product development race will be what it is, a race, and one would be presumptuous to assume that this product/service hasn't already been imagined or is currently being developed right now. After all, "ideas are easy. Execution is everything."(John Doerr)
